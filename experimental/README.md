# Experimental Directory

This folder contains experimental and work-in-progress code that is not ready for production.

## Purpose

- Prototyping new features
- Testing new approaches
- Sandbox for learning and exploration

## Guidelines

1. Code here is **not production-ready**
2. This folder is **git-ignored** to keep the repository clean
3. Move stable code to appropriate production folders
4. Document experiments for future reference

## Moving to Production

When experimental code is ready:

1. Write tests for the code
2. Move files to the appropriate folder (`app/`, `agent/`, etc.)
3. Update documentation
4. Create a pull request for review
